### Chat Flow
1. User selects or creates conversation
2. Messages (text/file) sent to backend
3. AI processing occurs (simulated in current implementation)
4. Response stored and returned to frontend
5. Real-time message updates via React Query

### Learning Flow
1. User browses available learning tracks
2. Video content accessed based on subscription plan
3. Progress tracked and updated in real-time
4. Completion status persisted to database

## User Preferences

```
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
CRITICAL RULES:
- NEVER delete any files without explicit permission
- ONLY use Supabase database - NO memory storage allowed
- Avoid rework - fix problems directly instead of rebuilding
- Focus on targeted solutions, not complete rewrites
